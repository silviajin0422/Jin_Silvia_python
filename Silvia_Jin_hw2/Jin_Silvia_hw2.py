### Problem 01 ###
'''
Write a version of a palindrome recogniser that accepts a file name from the
user, reads each line, and prints the line to the screen if it is a palindrome.
'''

def is_palindrome(word):
    '''
    This function is a palindrome recogniser.
    Input: a string of a word.
    Output: True if the word is a palindrome;
            False if the word is not a palindrome.
    '''
    ##Prof G - You need to handle mixed case. All but one of my test cases 
    ##Prof G - failed. You should strip the word of blanks, punctuation, and
    ##Prof G - and normalize case (either all upper or all lower) before
    ##Prof G - testing.
    if word == '': #base case: if the word is empty

### Problem 02 ###
'''
According to Wikipedia, a semordnilap is a word or phrase that spells a
different word or phrase backwards. ("Semordnilap" is itself "palindromes"
spelled backwards.) Write a semordnilap recogniser that accepts a file name
(pointing to a list of words) from the user and finds and prints all pairs
of words that are semordnilaps to the screen. For example, if "stressed"
and "desserts" is part of the word list, then the output should include the
pair "stressed desserts". Note, by the way, that each pair by itself forms
a palindrome!
'''

    '''
    This function is a semordnilap recogniser from a file
    Input: a string which is a filepath.

### Problem 04 ###
'''
The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) alphabet assigns code words to the letters of the English alphabet
acrophonically (Alfa for A, Bravo for B, etc.) so that critical combinations of letters (and numbers) can be pronounced
and understood by those who transmit and receive voice messages by radio or telephone regardless of their native
language, especially when the safety of navigation or persons is essential. Here is a Python dictionary covering one
version of the ICAO alphabet:
d = {'a':'alfa', 'b':'bravo', 'c':'charlie', 'd':'delta', 'e':'echo', 'f':'foxtrot',
     'g':'golf', 'h':'hotel', 'i':'india', 'j':'juliett', 'k':'kilo', 'l':'lima',
     'm':'mike', 'n':'november', 'o':'oscar', 'p':'papa', 'q':'quebec', 'r':'romeo',
     's':'sierra', 't':'tango', 'u':'uniform', 'v':'victor', 'w':'whiskey',
     'x':'x-ray', 'y':'yankee', 'z':'zulu'}
     
Your task in this exercise is to write a procedure speak_ICAO() able to translate any text (i.e. any string) into spoken
ICAO words. You need to import at least two libraries: os and time. On a mac, you have access to the system TTS
(Text-To-Speech) as follows: os.system('say ' + msg), where msg is the string to be spoken.
(Under UNIX/Linux and Windows, something similar might exist.)

Apart from the text to be spoken, your procedure also needs to accept two additional parameters: a float indicating the
length of the pause between each spoken ICAO word, and a float indicating the length of the pause between each word
spoken.
'''
import os
import time

##Prof G - Assignment requires a third parameter. There are two pause times.
##Prof G - The first the time to pause between letters and the second 
##Prof G - between words. Can't make your function work.
def speak_ICAO(msg,pauseTime):
    '''
    This functions takes in a message and prounance the message using ICAO.
    Input: msg: a string of words.
           pauseTime: a number which represent the pause time between words.
    When running the function in the terminal, we will hear the message pronounced.
    '''
    # create the ICAO dictionary
    d = {'a':'alfa', 'b':'bravo', 'c':'charlie',
         'd':'delta', 'e':'echo', 'f':'foxtrot', 'g':'golf', 'h':'hotel',
         'i':'india', 'j':'juliett', 'k':'kilo', 'l':'lima',
         'm':'mike', 'n':'november', 'o':'oscar', 'p':'papa',
         'q':'quebec', 'r':'romeo', 's':'sierra', 't':'tango',
         'u':'uniform', 'v':'victor', 'w':'whiskey', 'x':'x-ray', 'y':'yankee', 'z':'zulu'}
    # store the length of the message
    l = len(msg)
    # change the characters in the message to lowercase, for prounanciation purpose
    msg=msg.lower()
    for i in range(l): # look at each character in the message
        if msg[i] == ' ': # pause between words
            time.sleep(pauseTime)
        elif msg[i] in d: # otherwise, prounance the ICAO for the message

### Problem 05 ###
'''
A hapax legomenon (often abbreviated to hapax) is a word which occurs only once in either the written record of a
language, the works of an author, or in a single text. Define a function that given the file name of a text will return
all its hapaxes. Make sure your program ignores capitalization.

### Problem 06 ###
'''
Write a program that given a text file will create a new text file in which all the lines from the original file are
numbered from 1 to n (where n is the number of lines in the file).
'''

##Prof G - This will not work correctly. Prepending number to the filepath ends

##Prof G - parse the file path and then modify only the filename.

### Problem 07 ###
'''
Write a program that will calculate the average word length of a text stored in a file (i.e the sum of all the lengths
of the word tokens in the text, divided by the number of word tokens).
'''

##Prof G - Works well!
def aveLength(filepath):
    '''
    This function calculates the average word length of a text stored in a file.

Write a program able to play the "Guess the number"-game, where the number to be guessed is randomly chosen between 1

### Problem 10 ###
'''
In a game of Lingo, there is a hidden word, five characters long.
The object of the game is to find this word by guessing, and in return receive two kinds of clues:
1) the characters that are fully correct, with respect to identity as well as to position, and
2) the characters that are indeed present in the word, but which are placed in the wrong position.
Write a program with which one can play Lingo. Use square brackets to mark characters correct in the sense of 1), and
ordinary parentheses to mark characters correct in the sense of 2). Assuming, for example, that the program conceals the
word "tiger", you should be able to interact with it in the following way:
import lingo
snake
Clue: snak(e)
fiest
Clue: f[i](e)s(t)
times
Clue: [t][i]m[e]s
tiger
Clue: [t][i][g][e][r]

### Problem 11 ###
'''
A sentence splitter is a program capable of splitting a text into sentences. The standard set of heuristics for sentence
splitting includes (but isn't limited to) the following rules:

Sentence boundaries occur at one of "."(periods), "?" or "!", except that

a. Periods followed by whitespace followed by a lower case letter are not sentence boundaries.

b. Periods followed by a digit with no intervening whitespace are not sentence boundaries.

c. Periods followed by whitespace and then an upper case letter, but preceded by any of a short list of titles are
   not sentence boundaries. Sample titles include Mr., Mrs., Dr., and so on.

d. Periods internal to a sequence of letters with no adjacent whitespace are not sentence boundaries (for example,
   www.aptex.com, or e.g).

e. Periods followed by certain kinds of punctuation (notably comma and more periods) are probably not sentence boundaries.

Your task here is to write a program that given the name of a text file is able to write its content with each sentence
on a separate line. Test your program with the following short text: Mr. Smith bought cheapsite.com for 1.5 million dollars,
i.e. he paid a lot for it. Did he mind? Adam Jones Jr. thinks he didn't. In any case, this isn't true... Well, with a
probability of .9 it isn't. The result should be:

Mr. Smith bought cheapsite.com for 1.5 million dollars, i.e. he paid a lot for it. \n
Did he mind? \n
Adam Jones Jr. thinks he didnt. \n
In any case, this isn't true... \n
Well, with a probability of .9 it isn't.
